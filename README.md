# SolarPotentialUI

## Fixes
* you can drag the selected area
* if you enable scouting, then disable, then enable it again, draw an area... draw area function gets executed twice
* if you select the area, then click outside that area, then press reset, it doesn't get reset.
* there is a bbox value in geocode api which is maybe boundary box. It can be used to get area of property. 
* selecting option from address options is currently done casually.
* add instruction manual of some sort
